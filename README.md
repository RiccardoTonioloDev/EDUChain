# EDUChain
A blockchain created for students to learn the basics of blockchains.
It's intended not to be a distributed ledger, instead, it aims with it's centralization to let the students use it, crack it and even break it, to see how cryptographic
signatures could help with their relyability properties.
### IMPORTANT:
